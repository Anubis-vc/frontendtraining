Notes:

Created a simple weather system to familiarize myself with javascript promises and build on previous css and html concepts. 

Line 1 of the javascript code uses an API key which I have rotated for security. Trying to use env or calling the key without a backend is outside the scope of this quick code. Please go to openweathermap.org and generate your own api key for complete functionality.
